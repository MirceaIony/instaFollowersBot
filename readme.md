To run the InstaBot you will have to enter your credentials in the XPathConstants class:

<b>
username -> FAKE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME <br />
password -> FAKE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD
</b>

In case the InstaBot skips some steps, increase the sleep time. Your internet connection might be shitty.

Also you will have to install the chromedriver for selenium and add it's path to the CHROME_DRIVER_PATH field inside XPathConstants.
You can download the driver from <b>https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/</b>

<b>
chromedriver.exe path -> CHROME_DRIVER_PATH
</b>
